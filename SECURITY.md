# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security measures implemented in the Cryptowinufm faucet application.

## Backend Security

### 1. Environment Variables
- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
- Store sensitive data (private keys, database credentials) in environment variables
- Use separate keys for development and production
- Rotate keys regularly

### 2. Rate Limiting
```javascript
// API endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes
// Claim endpoint: 3 attempts per hour
```
- Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks
- Protects against brute force attempts
- Configurable limits per endpoint

### 3. Input Validation
- Ethereum address format validation using regex
- Parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection
- Type checking on all user inputs
- Sanitization of error messages

### 4. Security Headers (Helmet.js)
- Content Security Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-XSS-Protection

### 5. CORS Configuration
- Whitelist specific frontend domains
- Restrict HTTP methods to GET and POST
- Enable credentials only when necessary
- No wildcard origins in production

### 6. Error Handling
- Generic error messages to users
- Detailed logging for developers
- No stack traces exposed to clients
- Proper HTTP status codes

### 7. Database Security
- Parameterized queries (no string concatenation)
- Index on frequently queried columns
- Connection pooling with limits
- Automatic connection cleanup
- SSL/TLS for production connections

### 8. Private Key Management
```javascript
// ❌ NEVER DO THIS
const privateKey = "0x123...";

// ✅ DO THIS
const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
```
- Store in environment variables
- Never log private keys
- Use dedicated wallet (not personal wallet)
- Keep minimum balance needed
- Regular key rotation

## Frontend Security

### 1. XSS Prevention
- React automatically escapes values
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage
- Input sanitization before display
- Content Security Policy headers

### 2. API Communication
- HTTPS only in production
- Proper error handling
- No sensitive data in URL parameters
- JWT tokens (if implemented) in httpOnly cookies

### 3. Environment Variables
- Prefix with `VITE_` for client-side access
- No sensitive data in frontend env vars
- Separate config for dev/prod

## Deployment Security

### Railway (Backend)
- Enable automatic security updates
- Use Railway's secret management
- Enable SSL/TLS
- Regular security audits
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity

### Vercel (Frontend)
- Enable HTTPS by default
- Configure security headers
- Use environment variables
- Enable DDoS protection
- Regular dependency updates

## Ethereum Security

### 1. Wallet Security
- Use dedicated faucet wallet
- Keep only necessary funds
- Monitor balance regularly
- Set up alerts for low balance
- Hardware wallet for key generation (optional)

### 2. Transaction Security
- Gas estimation with buffer
- Transaction confirmation waiting
- Nonce management
- Retry logic for failed transactions
- Maximum gas price limits

### 3. Network Security
- Use reliable RPC providers (Infura, Alchemy)
- Fallback RPC endpoints
- Rate limiting on provider side
- Monitor provider status

## Monitoring & Alerts

### What to Monitor
1. **Wallet Balance**
   - Alert when below threshold
   - Daily balance checks

2. **Failed Transactions**
   - Log all failures
   - Alert on repeated failures

3. **Rate Limiting Triggers**
   - Track blocked IPs
   - Identify abuse patterns

4. **Database Performance**
   - Query execution times
   - Connection pool usage

5. **API Response Times**
   - Monitor endpoint latency
   - Set up uptime monitoring

### Recommended Tools
- Sentry for error tracking
- Datadog/New Relic for monitoring
- PagerDuty for alerts
- Etherscan API for transaction verification

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Private key secured and never committed
- [ ] CORS configured with frontend URL
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled and tested
- [ ] Database indexes created
- [ ] SSL/TLS enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Error messages sanitized
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Dependencies updated and audited

### After Deployment
- [ ] Test all endpoints
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works
- [ ] Check CORS configuration
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Set up alerts
- [ ] Test wallet balance alerts
- [ ] Verify transaction confirmations
- [ ] Check database backups

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Rotate keys quarterly
- [ ] Review logs weekly
- [ ] Monitor wallet balance daily
- [ ] Audit security settings quarterly
- [ ] Review access logs monthly

## Incident Response

### If Private Key is Compromised
1. **Immediately** transfer remaining funds to new wallet
2. Update `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable
3. Redeploy backend
4. Review transaction history
5. Investigate how compromise occurred
6. Update security measures

### If Database is Compromised
1. Take service offline
2. Assess extent of breach
3. Restore from backup
4. Update database credentials
5. Review access logs
6. Strengthen security measures

### If DDoS Attack Detected
1. Verify rate limiting is active
2. Consider adding Cloudflare
3. Temporarily increase rate limits if legitimate traffic
4. Block malicious IP ranges
5. Monitor resource usage
